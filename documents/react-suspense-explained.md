# React Suspense and useSuspenseQuery: Understanding the Flow

This document explains the differences between using React Query's suspense mode with and without a proper Suspense boundary.

## What is React Suspense?

React Suspense is a feature that lets your components "wait" for something before they render. It works by catching "thrown promises" rather than traditional errors, allowing for declarative loading states.

## What is useSuspenseQuery?

`useSuspenseQuery` is a hook from TanStack Query (React Query) that leverages React's Suspense mechanism for data fetching. Unlike the standard `useQuery`, which manages loading states internally, `useSuspenseQuery` throws promises that need to be caught by a Suspense boundary.

## What Happens WITHOUT Suspense

When you use `useSuspenseQuery` without wrapping the component in a `<Suspense>` boundary, you create an infinite rendering loop:

1. The component tries to render
2. `useSuspenseQuery` throws a Promise when data isn't ready
3. No `<Suspense>` component catches this Promise
4. React re-renders the component after the uncaught Promise
5. The component renders again, throwing another Promise
6. This creates an infinite loop of rendering → throwing Promise → re-rendering

```jsx
// ❌ Problematic implementation without Suspense
function EventList({ spaceId }) {
  // This will cause an infinite loop without a Suspense boundary
  const { data } = useEventsQuery(spaceId);

  return (
    <div>
      {data.events.map(event => (
        <EventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This happens because:
- The Promise is thrown during rendering
- Without a Suspense boundary, React doesn't know how to handle this Promise
- React attempts to re-render after the uncaught Promise
- The same Promise is thrown again, creating an infinite loop

## What Happens WITH Suspense

When you properly use `useSuspenseQuery` with a `<Suspense>` boundary, the flow works as intended:

1. The component tries to render
2. `useSuspenseQuery` throws a Promise when data isn't ready
3. The parent `<Suspense>` component catches this Promise
4. `<Suspense>` renders its fallback UI (like a loading spinner)
5. Behind the scenes, React "remembers" the thrown Promise and waits for it to resolve
6. When the Promise resolves (data is fetched successfully):
   - React attempts to render the component again
   - This time `useSuspenseQuery` returns the fetched data instead of throwing
   - The component renders successfully with the data
   - The `<Suspense>` fallback is replaced with the actual component

```jsx
// ✅ Correct implementation with Suspense
function EventListContainer({ spaceId }) {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <EventList spaceId={spaceId} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function EventList({ spaceId }) {
  // Now safely used with a Suspense boundary
  const { data } = useEventsQuery(spaceId);

  return (
    <div>
      {data.events.map(event => (
        <EventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Benefits of Using Suspense Properly

1. **Declarative Loading States**: Loading states are handled at the boundary level, not scattered throughout components
2. **Simplified Component Logic**: Components can be written assuming data is available
3. **Coordinated Loading**: Multiple data dependencies can be coordinated through a single Suspense boundary
4. **Cleaner Code**: No need for conditional rendering or loading checks in your components
5. **Improved User Experience**: Loading states can be designed at the layout level

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting the Suspense Boundary**: Always wrap components using `useSuspenseQuery` in a `<Suspense>` boundary
2. **Nesting Issues**: Be mindful of nested Suspense boundaries and how they interact
3. **Error Boundaries**: Consider pairing Suspense with Error Boundaries for complete handling of async operations
4. **SSR Considerations**: Server-side rendering requires special handling with Suspense

## Best Practices

1. Place Suspense boundaries at layout boundaries where loading states make sense
2. Use multiple Suspense boundaries to create a progressive loading experience
3. Combine with Error Boundaries for robust error handling
4. Consider using React.lazy() with Suspense for code splitting

## Conclusion

React Suspense with `useSuspenseQuery` provides a powerful pattern for handling asynchronous data fetching, but it requires proper implementation. Always ensure components using `useSuspenseQuery` are wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary to avoid infinite rendering loops and to take full advantage of React's declarative loading state management.
